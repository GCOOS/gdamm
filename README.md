This project will collect a series of json files consisting primarily of linestrings. There are four regions, which can be found in the data directory: gcoos, caracoos, maracoos and secoora. Each file will contain the linestring for one deployment of an autonomous underwater vehicle. The data will cover the years 2023,2024 and 2025. We want to build a clean, professional looking single page web app that displays the linetracks of all the deployments on a Leaflet map. Each year should be a different color. Each region can be the same color -- we don't need to distinguish between regions, only years. There should be a 'save to png' button so we can produce a publication worthy image. We will start by testing only file from the gcoos region. I will provide the filename. Once the basic app is working, we will add additional files to each region and test as we continue to ingest new data. NOTE: Let's plan on creating a DuckDB of all the missions, so we don't have to continually parse the JSON files. We therefore will need a standalone app that can take --data-file and --db as args and update the DuckDB file. Once we have all data ingested, we'll need a 'create_map' app that takes --db and --output-path args and produces the html map.
